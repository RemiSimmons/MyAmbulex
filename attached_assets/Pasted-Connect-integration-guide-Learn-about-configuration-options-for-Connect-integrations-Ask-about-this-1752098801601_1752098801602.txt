Create and onboard accounts
Stripe enables you to create accounts on behalf of users, called connected accounts. When using Connect, you create connected accounts for each user that receives money on your platform.

API
Send connected accounts to a Stripe-hosted onboarding flow. Stripe-hosted onboarding allows you to redirect your user to Stripe to complete the onboarding process in a co-branded interface.

Best for when you want to launch quickly with the lowest integration effort:

Connected accounts leave your site and are redirected to Stripe to complete the flow.
Co-branding with Stripe and limited options to customize.
Stripe handles all of the onboarding flow logic.
Automatically supports 46+ countries and 14 languages.
Set up dashboard flows
Connected accounts need access to a dashboard to manage their account. Provide connected accounts with access to the Stripe Dashboard, the Express Dashboard, or a dashboard built using the Stripe API and embedded components.

Express

None
Provide access to the Express dashboard for connected accounts to manage their account.

The Express Dashboard enables connected accounts to view their available balance, see upcoming payouts, and track their earnings in real time. Users can’t manage refunds or disputes through the Express dashboard. Users have access to Stripe support and Stripe can reach out and communicate with users about their account.

Use the Express Dashboard when:

Your users are marketplace sellers that need limited access to workflows.
You primarily send payouts to these users. Users won’t manage refunds or disputes directly.
You want to fully brand the dashboard look and feel.
You are comfortable taking responsibility for negative balance liability and managing risk of loss on connected accounts.
You can always add embedded components to your own website in tandem with providing access to the Stripe Dashboard.

Accept a payment
You create a charge to accept a payment from a customer on behalf of your connected account. The type of charge you create:

Determines how payment funds are split among all parties involved
Impacts how the charge appears on the customer’s bank or billing statement (with your platform’s information or your user’s)
Determines which account Stripe debits for refunds and chargebacks
Charge type:
Charge type:

Separate charges and transfers
Create separate charges and transfers to transfer funds from one payment to multiple connected accounts, or when a specific user isn’t known at the time of charge. The charge on your platform account is decoupled from the transfers to your connected accounts.

This charge type is best suited for marketplaces that need to split payments between multiple parties, such as DoorDash, a restaurant delivery platform.

While separate charges and transfers provide a lot of flexibility, they require a more complex integration to manage account balances between your platform and your users. You must monitor your platform account balance carefully to make sure you have enough available funds to cover the transfer amount.

Unless you’re eligible for cross-border payouts, your platform and the connected account you transfer funds to must be in the same region to use separate charges and transfers. Attempting to transfer funds across a disallowed border returns an error.

Stripe fees
Who pays fees:
Who pays fees:

Your connected accounts

Your platform
Stripe collects Stripe fees from your platform account, inclusive of processing fees. You control the processing fee amounts you bill connected accounts. Use the application fee parameter to collect processing fees from your connected accounts.








Pay out users
When the funds from the payment settle and your user’s connected account has a positive Stripe balance, you can pay out those funds to their external account.

By default, Stripe pays out funds that have settled in your connected accounts’ balances on a daily rolling basis. If you prefer, you can configure different automatic payout schedules, trigger payouts manually instead of automatically, or pay out instantly.

Responsibility for negative balances
Negative balance liability:
Negative balance liability:

Stripe

Platform
Your platform is liable for losses incurred by negative balances on your connected accounts. Your platform is responsible for reviewing new connected accounts during onboarding and determining the risk profile of your users.

Recommended for marketplaces that collect payments from buyers to payout sellers, or for advanced platforms that want full control over how risk and negative liabilities are managed on connected accounts:

Your platform must monitor connected accounts for ongoing risk of loss.
Your platform has to build flows to communicate and remediate connected accounts when you detect fraud or risk.
You have both the operational team and the engineering resources to establish processes for managing ongoing risk of loss and preventing fraud.
Before creating accounts with this setup, carefully consider and acknowledge your platform responsibilities for negative balance liabilities.
