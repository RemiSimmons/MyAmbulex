Based on the console log, there are multiple issues affecting Google Maps in the website preview:

## Main Errors Causing Flickering

1. **Multiple Google Maps API Inclusions**:
   - The warning "You have included the Google Maps JavaScript API multiple times on this page" indicates duplicate script inclusions, which can cause conflicts and flickering.

2. **Element Definition Conflicts**:
   - Multiple warnings about elements already being defined (e.g., "gmp-map" already defined)
   - This suggests the Google Maps components are being initialized multiple times

3. **Directions API Failures**:
   - Repeated errors "Directions request failed with status: ZERO_RESULTS"
   - These continuous failed requests could trigger UI refreshes causing flickering

4. **Deprecated API Usage**:
   - The application is using several deprecated Google Maps services (PlacesService, AutocompleteService, Marker)
   - Deprecated APIs may have performance or compatibility issues

## Suggested Fixes

1. **Remove Duplicate API Inclusions**:
   - Ensure the Google Maps API script is included only once in the application
   - Look for multiple `<script>` tags loading the Maps API or components loading it separately

2. **Implement Proper Async Loading**:
   - Follow Google's recommended loading patterns (referenced in the warning with link to goo.gl/js-api-loading)
   - Use a single async loader with proper callback handling

3. **Address the Directions API Issues**:
   - The repeated "ZERO_RESULTS" suggests invalid route requests or destination coordinates
   - Verify that valid addresses/coordinates are being used for directions requests
   - Implement proper error handling to prevent continuous failed requests

4. **Update to Modern Google Maps APIs**:
   - Migrate from deprecated services to recommended ones as indicated in the warnings:
     - Use google.maps.places.Place instead of PlacesService
     - Use google.maps.places.AutocompleteSuggestion instead of AutocompleteService
     - Use google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement instead of Marker

5. **Check API Key and Billing**:
   - Ensure the project has proper API key configuration and billing setup
   - This might be related to the ReferrerNotAllowedMapError from your previous screenshot

The flickering is most likely caused by the combination of duplicate API inclusions and the continuous failed directions requests triggering rendering cycles.
