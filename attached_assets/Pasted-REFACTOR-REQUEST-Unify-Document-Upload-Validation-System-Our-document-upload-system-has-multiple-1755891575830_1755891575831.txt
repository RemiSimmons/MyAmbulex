REFACTOR REQUEST: Unify Document Upload & Validation System

Our document upload system has multiple validation approaches causing conflicts and failures. Instead of fixing individual bugs, please refactor to create a unified, reliable system.

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- 3 different validation methods with conflicting rules
- FormData corruption through apiRequest wrapper
- Inconsistent error handling across components
- Multiple upload approaches (fetch vs apiRequest)
- MIME type mismatches between frontend/backend

REFACTORING GOALS:

1. **Single Source of Truth for Validation**
   - Create ONE validation service used by frontend AND backend
   - Consistent file type, size, and content validation rules
   - Shared validation logic between all upload components

2. **Unified Upload Flow**
   - Standardize all upload components to use same approach
   - Remove apiRequest wrapper for file uploads (use fetch directly)
   - Consistent error handling and user feedback
   - Unified loading states and progress indication

3. **Clean Architecture**
   - Separate validation logic from upload logic
   - Clear data flow: Validate → Upload → Store → Update UI
   - Consistent document type mapping throughout system
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces that match actual data

4. **Better User Experience**
   - Immediate client-side validation before upload attempt
   - Clear, specific error messages (not generic "upload failed")
   - Consistent UI patterns across all upload components

SUGGESTED APPROACH:
1. Create shared validation utility (client + server compatible)
2. Create unified upload service (handles FormData properly)
3. Refactor all upload components to use unified services
4. Update TypeScript interfaces to match actual implementation
5. Implement proper error translation system

FILES TO REFACTOR:
- All upload components (verification-section.tsx, document-upload-with-validation.tsx, etc.)
- Server upload route (upload.ts)
- Validation logic (requirements.ts)
- apiRequest utility
- TypeScript interfaces

PRIORITY: Focus on creating clean, maintainable code rather than quick fixes. This system needs to be reliable for production use.
